// A runner, who runs with base speed s with duration t will cover a distances d: d = s * t
// However, this runner can sprint for one unit of time with double speed s * 2
// After sprinting, base speed s will permanently reduced by 1, and for next one unit of time runner will enter recovery phase and can't sprint again.

// Your task, given base speed s and time t, is to find the maximum possible distance d.
// Input:

// 1 <= s < 1000
// 1 <= t < 1000
// Example:

// Given s = 2 and t = 4.
// We could schedule when runner should sprint so we could get these possible sequences:

// Seq.: RRRR
// => s + s + s + s
// => 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8
// Seq.: RRRS
// => s + s + s + s*2
// => 2 + 2 + 2 + 2*2 = 10
// Seq.: RRSR
// => s + s + s*2 + (s-1)
// => 2 + 2 + 2*2 + (2-1) = 9
// Seq.: RSRR
// => s + s*2 + (s-1) + (s-1)
// => 2 + 2*2 + (2-1) + (2-1) = 8
// Seq.: RSRS
// => s + s*2 + (s-1) + (s-1)*2
// => 2 + 2*2 + (2-1) + (2-1)*2 = 9
// Seq.: SRRR
// => s*2 + (s-1) + (s-1) + (s-1)
// => 2*2 + (2-1) + (2-1) + (2-1) = 7
// Seq.: SRRS
// => s*2 + (s-1) + (s-1) + (s-1)*2
// => 2*2 + (2-1) + (2-1) + (2-1)*2 = 8
// Seq.: SRSR
// => s*2 + (s-1) + (s-1)*2 + (s-1-1)
// => 2*2 + (2-1) + (2-1)*2 + (2-1-1) = 7

// Where:
// - R: Normal Run / Recovery
// - S: Sprint

// Based on above sequences, the maximum possible distance d is 10.
